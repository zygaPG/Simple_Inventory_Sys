# Simple Inventory and Crafting System 🪚

This project features a basic inventory and item crafting system with three types of items: wood, stone, and iron.

## Features🏄

- **Inventory and Crafting:**
  - Three types of items available: Wood, Stone, and Iron.
  - Items are represented in the game space and as ScriptableObjects.
  - The inventory slots are displayed on the bottom bar, with six available slots.
  - You can choose which slot to place an item in.
  - Items can stack in the inventory.
  - If you place an item in a slot that already contains a different type of item, the existing item will be discarded.
  - You can manually discard items from the inventory.
  - A set of instructions with button controls is available in the top-right corner of the screen.
  - You can toggle the crafting window on and off.
  - While the crafting window is active, you cannot pick up or discard items.
  - Crafting recipes include Nails, Planks, an Axe, and a Spiked Club.
  - Crafting has a chance to fail; each item has its own success rate.

## Crafting Recipes👇

1. **Wood + Wood = Plank**
2. **Plank + Stone = Stone Axe**
3. **Iron + Iron = Nail**
4. **Plank + Nail = Spiked Club**

## Notes🧻

- All 3D models were created by me using Blender, and it took me 6 minutes.
- I developed all components myself except for the Outline, for which I used Simple Outline.
